<question>
<test>Which of Newton's Laws best describes the behavior of a rocket motor?</test>
<A>a. Newton's First Law: A body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it.</A>
<B>b. Newton's Second Law: The rate of change of momentum is proportional to the force impressed and is in the same direction as that force.</B>
<C>c. Newton's Third Law: To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction.</C>
<sol>C</sol>
<ans>c. Newton's Third Law. Applying a force in one direction always results in an equal force in the opposite direction.</ans>
</question>

<question>
<test>How does Newton's Third Law "To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction" relate to rocketry?</test>
<A>a. That the blast deflector must be strong enough to push the rocket off the launch pad at ignition.</A>
<B>b. That a rocket flies because the rocket motor "pushes" the rocket in a direction opposite of the exhaust jet.</B>
<C>c. That the thrust of a rocket motor is proportional to the air density at the launch site.</C>

<C>c. Motor thrust, weight and aerodynamic drag.</C>
<sol>C</sol>
<ans>c. The motor thrust, weight and aerodynamic drag are the primary forces considered when determining the altitude of a rocket. Please note that the weight of the rocket must consider the lift-off weight and the weight at burn-out to be complete.</ans>
</question>

<question>
<test>For an inherently stable rocket, which statement about the center of gravity (CG) and the center of pressure (CP) is true?</test>
<A>a. The CG must be behind the CP relative to the desired direction of flight.</A>
<B>b. The CG must be forward of the CP relative to the desired direction of flight.</B>
<C>c. The CG must move forward (in the desired direction of flight) during the motor burn.</C>
<sol>B</sol>
<ans>b. The center of pressure (CP) is where the aerodynamic lift, due to the rocket being at a non-zero angle of attack, is centered. For an aerodynamically stable rocket with the CP behind the center of gravity (CG), the lift which is centered aft of the CG will create a corrective moment to return the rocket to zero degrees angle of attack. Conversely, if the CP is ahead of the CG the lift will attempt to turn the rocket around so that the CP will again be behind the CG. This resultant "tumbling" is characteristic of an unstable rocket.</ans>
</question>

<question>
<test>A 4" diameter rocket with its motor is determined to have the center of gravity (CG) four inches behind the center of pressure (CP). Is this a rocket likely to be stable?</test>

<C>c. Yes, the CP is one body diameter in front of the CG.</C>
<sol>B</sol>
<ans>b. The rocket is not stable because if the rocket rotated around its center of gravity (CG), the greater aerodynamic force forward of the CG would cause the rocket to rotate even farther, resulting in an unstable flight.</ans>
</question>

<C>c. The point at which aerodynamic lift on a rocket is centered.</C>
<sol>C</sol>
<ans>c. The center of pressure (CP) is the point on the rocket where the aerodynamic lift is centered. This means that aerodynamic lift, if the rocket is at a non-zero angle of attack, forward of this point is balanced by the aerodynamic lift aft of that point.</ans>
</question>

<question>
<test>What is the "rule-of-thumb" for a stable rocket?</test>

<C>c. It is not necessary to test for the center of gravity when using a heavier motor because it has more thrust.</C>
<sol>A</sol>
<ans>a. Measuring the center of gravity (CG) by balancing the rocket requires that the rocket be prepared as though ready for flight. It is especially important to check when using a heavier motor than previously flown.</ans>
</question>

<question>
<test>What ordinarily happens to the center of gravity (CG) of a rocket during a solid rocket motor's thrusting phase?</test>
<A>a. The CG stays the same.</A>
<B>b. The CG shifts forward.</B>
<C>c. The CG shifts aft.</C>
<sol>B</sol>
<ans>b. As the propellant burns the motor gets lighter and thus moves the balance point or center of gravity (CG) forward. This is why a marginally stable rocket may "act squirrelly" at launch, then stabilize and fly straight.</ans>
</question>

<question>
<test>How can a statically unstable rocket be made stable?</test>

</question>

<question>
<test>What are three methods used to shift the center of gravity (CG) of a rocket forward?</test>
<A>a. Add weight to the nose, make the rocket longer, install larger fins.</A>
<B>b. Add weight to the nose, make the rocket longer, use a smaller (or lighter) motor.</B>
<C>c. Add weight to the nose, make the rocket shorter, use a smaller motor.</C>
<sol>B</sol>
<ans>b. Moving the CG forward requires judicious design changes. The following are given as "rules of thumb": Adding weight to the nose moves the CG forward by counterbalancing the rocket. Think of the rocket as a lever; making the rocket longer shifts the CG forward by making the lever longer. Using a smaller (or lighter) motor reduces the weight aft thus shifting the CG forward.</ans>
</question>

<question>
<test>What are three methods used to shift the center of pressure (CP) aft?</test>
<A>a. Make the rocket shorter, use larger fins, increase the number of fins.</A>
<B>b. Make the rocket shorter, use smaller fins, add weight to the nose.</B>
<C>c. Make the rocket shorter, change the number of fins, use a longer launch rod.</C>
<sol>A</sol>
<ans>a. Moving the CP aft requires judicious design changes. The following are given as "rules of thumb": Increasing the total fin area will move the CP aft. This can be accomplished by increasing the area on each fin and/or increasing the number of fins. The CP can also be shifted aft by making the rocket shorter. This alone is generally not preferred because the CG is also shifted aft and the CP/CG stability relationship may be compromised.</ans>

<question>
<test>A small hole is typically drilled near the top of a high power rocket's airframe, below the nosecone or payload section. Why?</test>
<A>a. This hole vents ecxessive ejection charge pressure, reducing shock cord stress.</A>
<B>b. The hole permits on-board altimeters to obtain air pressure readings.</B>
<C>c. The hole vents internal air pressure as the rocket gains altitude to prevent premature separation.</C>
<sol>C</sol>
<ans>c. Air pressure external to the rocket decreases as the rocket ascends. Trapped (higher) pressure within the rocket can prematurely separate the rocket. The hole vents this internal pressure to prevent separation. Note: The hole size is dependent on the size of the rocket and volume of air to be vented; larger airframes require larger holes. Use caution in locating the hole so the nose cone or payload coupler does not block the hole. Be sure to position the hole such that ejection charge pressure is not vented before recovery system deployment.</ans>

<question>
<test>What is the major issue with accelerometer-based altimeters?</test>
<A>a. They are larger, and usually much more expensive, than pressure-sensor altimeters.</A>
<B>b. They do not have multiple capabilities such as dual deployment, ignition of airstarts, etc.</B>
<C>c. They may not deploy properly if the flight is significantly non-vertical.</C>
<sol>C</sol>
<ans>c. Accelerometers can be quite small, need not be expensive, and can have the same multiple capabilities as pressure-sensor altimeters. But the electronics of an accelerometer assume a nearly vertical light, so that a flight that deviates significantly from vertical may have problems</ans>
